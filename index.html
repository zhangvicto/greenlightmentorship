                        Green Light's first event was a panelist session called The Hangout, where high school students were invited to meet & ask 10 university students from various fields across Ontario anything! Over the span of two days, over 70 attendees asked 20 university students questions about their program, their university experience and .We hope that this will help you when deciding between programs and act as an opportunity to meet new university and high school students!
