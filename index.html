                Green Light is a mentorship program based in Ontario, Canada, that pairs high school students with a Canadian university student mentor based on their interests, academic course needs and post-secondary program choice.
                <p>Green Light mentors aim to offer high school students support by providing advice, guidance, and extra help with their academics. Green Light’s mission is to help as many students as possible with their transition back to school or to university.
                </p>

                <p>In addition to the mentorship program, Green Light provides access to free resources, virtual events and a supportive community on social media that connects students across the country.

                    In light of the recent cancellation of the official Ontario University Fair (OUF), Green Light is hosting a 2-day virtual OUF to help high school students & parents access first-hand information from university students. This event will feature an array of workshops that touch on various topics such as the application process, the transition from the high school to university, university features, etc. You will have a chance to interact with current university students who are trained to provide you with information, and support you in any way!

                        Green Light's first event was a panelist session called The Hangout, where high school students were invited to meet & ask 10 university students from various fields across Ontario anything! Over the span of two days, over 70 attendees asked 20 university students questions about their program, their university experience and .We hope that this will help you when deciding between programs and act as an opportunity to meet new university and high school students!

        <div class="titles">FAQ</div>
        
        <div class="faq-question">
            My mentor/mentee has not reached out to me, even though I emailed them. What should I do? 
        
        <button onclick="faqShowHide('a1')" class="faq-show-button"></button>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-answer" id="a1">
            The first step we suggest is to simply email them again! There is a high chance that they have not checked their email yet, or that the email got lost somewhere in their mailbox. If they still do not reply after a while, we encourage you to fill out our re-match form, and we will find you another mentor ASAP. However, please be patient with us as based on the program & university you are 
        </div>
        
        
        <div class="faq-question">
            How should I approach my mentee/mentor? How do I initiate a conversation?
        </div>                
            
        <div class="faq-answer" id="a2">
            The best way to do this is to simply introduce yourself! Introduce your name, your school and program or program of interest, and anything you’d be willing to help with or need help with! Whether this is answering questions about the school, the program, or with course help, make sure to let them know. Just simply ask your match about the kind of help they are offering/looking for! Mentees, remember that your mentors are here to offer their support and guidance, so do not be afraid of asking questions!
            <br>
            Some topics / prompts to ask your mentee/mentor: 
            Favourite quarantine activity 
            Favourite part of university 
            Extracurricular / Academic Interests 
            Other programs that you applied to
        </div>    
    

        <div class="faq-question">
            As a mentor / mentee, can I be paired up with more than one person? If I do, what should I do? 
        </div>   
            
        <div class="faq-answer" id="a3">
            Yes! Since this has been brought to our attention, we have made some new changes to our form. For new mentors and mentees signing up, you now have the option of choosing how many mentors / mentees you would like to be paired up with. If you have already been matched and would like to be matched again with an additional mentor / mentee, please email us and let us know how many mentors or mentees you would like to be paired with. Another avenue to be re-matched or matched with additional mentees will be a form that will be posted in early May, so keep a look out for that. We do our best to accommodate everyone, with the diverse amount of interest we were provided. 
        </div>
            

        <div class="faq-question">
            When are matches sent out? Is there a signup deadline?
        </div>            

        <div class="faq-answer" id="a4">
            We try our very best to send out a new round of matches every Wednesday night so that we can revisit previous un-matched mentors or mentees as well as match our new sign ups. There is no deadline to sign up, we will have the form open for everyone for as long as there is interest.
        </div>            
            

        <div class="faq-question">
            What should I do if my mentor/mentee is not in the program or field of interest I stated in my form? 
        </div>  

        <div class="faq-answer" id="a5">
            If this is the case, we as a team truly apologize for the mistake in the match. We try our very best to match to the best of our abilities. However, oftentimes program names can be unique at every university. Please email us, as we would gladly re-match both mentors and mentees, so that you can receive the best personalized guidance and support. We also will have a re-match form coming out in early May, if you feel more comfortable just filling out a form.
