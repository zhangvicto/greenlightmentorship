                            Green Light's first event was a panelist session called The Hangout, where high school
                            students
                            were invited to meet & ask 10 university students from various fields across Ontario
                            anything!
                            Over the span of two days, over 70 attendees asked 20 university students questions about
                            their
                            program, their university experience and .We hope that this will help you when deciding
                            between
                            programs and act as an opportunity to meet new university and high school students!

    <!-- FAQ -->
    <div class="page" id="page7">
        <div class="titles">FAQ</div>

        <div class="faq-question">
            My mentor/mentee has not reached out to me, even though I emailed them. What should I do?
            <button onclick="faqShowHide('a1')" class="faq-show-button"><img src="img/dropdown.png"
                    height=20px;></button>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-answer" id="a1" style="display: none;">
            The first step we suggest is to simply email them again! There is a high chance that they have not checked
            their email yet, or that the email got lost somewhere in their mailbox. If they still do not reply after a
            while, we encourage you to fill out our re-match form, and we will find you another mentor ASAP. However,
            please be patient with us as based on the program & university you are
        </div>


        <div class="faq-question">
            How should I approach my mentee/mentor? How do I initiate a conversation?
            <button onclick="faqShowHide('a2')" class="faq-show-button"><img src="img/dropdown.png"
                    height=20px;></button>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-answer" id="a2" style="display: none;">
            The best way to do this is to simply introduce yourself! Introduce your name, your school and program or
            program of interest, and anything you’d be willing to help with or need help with! Whether this is answering
            questions about the school, the program, or with course help, make sure to let them know. Just simply ask
            your match about the kind of help they are offering/looking for! Mentees, remember that your mentors are
            here to offer their support and guidance, so do not be afraid of asking questions!
            <br>
            <br>Some topics / prompts to ask your mentee/mentor:
            <br>Favourite quarantine activity
            <br>Favourite part of university
            <br>Extracurricular / Academic Interests
            <br>Other programs that you applied to
        </div>


        <div class="faq-question">
            As a mentor / mentee, can I be paired up with more than one person? If I do, what should I do?
            <button onclick="faqShowHide('a3')" class="faq-show-button"><img src="img/dropdown.png"
                    height=20px;></button>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-answer" id="a3" style="display: none;">
            Yes! Since this has been brought to our attention, we have made some new changes to our form. For new
            mentors and mentees signing up, you now have the option of choosing how many mentors / mentees you would
            like to be paired up with. If you have already been matched and would like to be matched again with an
            additional mentor / mentee, please email us and let us know how many mentors or mentees you would like to be
            paired with. Another avenue to be re-matched or matched with additional mentees will be a form that will be
            posted in early May, so keep a look out for that. We do our best to accommodate everyone, with the diverse
            amount of interest we were provided.
        </div>


        <div class="faq-question">
            When are matches sent out? Is there a signup deadline?
            <button onclick="faqShowHide('a4')" class="faq-show-button"><img src="img/dropdown.png"
                    height=20px;></button>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-answer" id="a4" style="display: none;">
            We try our very best to send out a new round of matches every Wednesday night so that we can revisit
            previous un-matched mentors or mentees as well as match our new sign ups. There is no deadline to sign up,
            we will have the form open for everyone for as long as there is interest.
        </div>


        <div class="faq-question">
            What should I do if my mentor/mentee is not in the program or field of interest I stated in my form?
            <button onclick="faqShowHide('a5')" class="faq-show-button"><img src="img/dropdown.png"
                    height=20px;></button>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-answer" id="a5" style="display: none;">
            If this is the case, we as a team truly apologize for the mistake in the match. We try our very best to
            match to the best of our abilities. However, oftentimes program names can be unique at every university.
            Please email us, as we would gladly re-match both mentors and mentees, so that you can receive the best
            personalized guidance and support. We also will have a re-match form coming out in early May, if you feel
            more comfortable just filling out a form.
